Challenge in Data Modeling: Handling Multiple Date Fields
# Handling Multiple Date Columns in Power BI Data Modeling

In real-world data models, it is common to encounter fact tables with **multiple date columns**‚Äîfor instance, `order_date` and `ship_date`. Customers often want to analyze KPIs from **multiple date perspectives**, such as year-over-year trends for orders vs. shipments. This introduces complexity because Power BI allows only **one active relationship** between a date column and a date dimension table at a time.

This project demonstrates how to **effectively manage multiple date fields** in your data model using two industry-standard techniques:

---

## üß© Use Case

Our sales fact table contains two key date fields:
- `order_date`
- `ship_date`

To support flexible time-based reporting, we created a **calendar date dimension** (`Date`) that includes all calendar days, enabling continuous time-series visuals and filling gaps in the data.

## ‚ùì The Challenge

Power BI supports only **one active relationship** between a date dimension and the fact table. This makes it difficult to create visuals or measures that switch between `order_date` and `ship_date`.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution Approaches

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Role-Playing Dimensions

We create **separate date dimension tables** for each role:

- `Order_Date_Dim`
- `Ship_Date_Dim`

Each is linked to its respective date field in the fact table:
```plaintext
Sales[order_date] ‚Äî> Order_Date_Dim[Date]
Sales[ship_date]  ‚Äî> Ship_Date_Dim[Date]

These separate dimensions can then be **linked to the corresponding fields in the fact table**.  
In your visuals, you simply use the **relevant date dimension** depending on the analytical context.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Inactive Relationships with DAX

Power BI allows us to define **multiple relationships** between two tables, but **only one can be active at a time**.

To leverage the inactive relationship, we use the `USERELATIONSHIP()` function in DAX.
This explicitly tells the engine to use the **inactive relationship** for a specific calculation, giving you **full control** over which **date context** to apply in your analysis.

And the DAX which we can use for this is:
